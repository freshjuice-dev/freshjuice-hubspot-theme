FreshJuice DEV is a modern, clean, and minimalistic HubSpot CMS theme designed specifically for developers.
Built with **Tailwind CSS** and **Alpine.js**, it offers full flexibility and a clean architecture, making it easy to customize and extend for real-world production use.

## Purpose

This theme helps developers get a head start on HubSpot CMS theme development.
While most HubSpot themes are heavy and bloated, FreshJuice DEV is intentionally minimal — it loads only the components you actually need, resulting in a pixel-perfect design and a fast-loading website.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
